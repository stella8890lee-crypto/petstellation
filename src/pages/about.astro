	<p>
		Petstellation was born from a deep love for animals, nature, and the stars above. We believe that
        creatures like cats and dogs, though they may be small, carry the purest truths of the universe 
        within them. Their warmth, their kindness, and their way of loving are simple, honest, and timeless
        - unchanged by the chaos of the world.

	<p>
		Sometimes we like to imagine that they come from magical places - Cat Planet, Dog Planet - sent
        to Earth to remind us what love really means. Maybe they’re here to rescue us in their own gentle 
        way. And maybe, just maybe, it’s our turn to learn how to truly love them back.
	</p>

	<p>
		Petstellation is our way of giving back. With everything we create and share, we hope to honor the
        animals who bring light to our lives - and connect with fellow souls who feel the same. Let’s care
        for them with the love they deserve.
