	<p>
		Petstellation was born from a deep love for animals, nature, and the stars above. We believe that creatures like 
        cats and dogs, though they may be small, carry the purest truths of the universe within them. Their warmth, their 
        kindness, and their way of loving are simple, honest, and timeless - unchanged by the chaos of the world.
	</p>

	<p>
		Sometimes we like to imagine that they come from magical places - Cat Planet, Dog Planet - sent to Earth to remind 
        us what love really means. Maybe they’re here to rescue us in their own gentle way. And maybe, just maybe, it’s our 
        turn to learn how to truly love them back.
	</p>

	<p>
		Petstellation is our way of giving back. With everything we create and share, we hope to honor the animals who bring 
        light to our lives - and connect with fellow souls who feel the same. Let’s care for them with the love they deserve.
